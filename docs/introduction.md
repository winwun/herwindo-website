# Introduction

I’m a software engineer with over 10 years of experience. I started my career in the Philippines as a **systems engineer**, focusing on automation and integrating third-party tools to reduce manual work. Later, I moved into web development and worked as a full-stack engineer on various projects for a consultancy firm.

I eventually worked abroad at JobStreet (Seek) in Malaysia, where I discovered the power of cloud technologies. This experience showed me that software engineering is more than just frontend and backend development—it’s also about understanding the infrastructure that supports applications.
